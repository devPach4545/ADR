# Decided to implement offline version of dev journal and wrap with Electron JS

## Context and Problem Statement
We were discussing if we want to make our application such that it can be accessed both online and offline. We also knew that we could only use HTML, CSS, and JS to keep it as minmul with frameworks. So, we figured that using fancy stacks won't be helpful. Prof Powell mentioned in the class that Electron JS could be used to make a desktop app with the permission from a TA. 


## Decision Drivers
- We only have 5 weeks, we were not sure if implementing an online version is possible
- Nobody had experience with user authentication and other requirements needed to make an online dev journal
- We wanted to implement local first and then go online if time permits


## Considered Options

* Offline desktop app using Electron JS
* Online web application
* Hybrid solution combining offline and online capabilities

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Offline desktop app using Electron JS"
