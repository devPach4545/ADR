# Decision: Using labels to search for a keyword

## Context and Problem Statement:
- We were deliberating the key features to embed in our development journal. One of these features involved facilitating users to search for a specific keyword. 
For instance, if a user needs to find a previously documented bug or any other information they've stored, they would do so using a labeling system. 
## Decision Drivers:

- Ease of User interaction
- Searching inside the text was not valuable enough for us

## Considered Options:

- A search bar

## Decision Outcome:
- We opted for using labels with priorities for keyword search.
